SQL			-> 1 exercise

No prior message queue knowledge is expected

General Instructions:
	Ask Questions as soon as you have, please dont wait for Q&A part
	Feedback: Session pacing, Network issue

Special expectations: Would like to know indepth working on kafka ecosystem
Kafka Security for Both Producer and COnsumer using SSL or any authentication mechanism.
Kafka bridges

If you can provide Reactive Kafka with Spring boot
To Understand the Event driven architecture in better way while developing Micro services
Confluent cloud, Kafka Streams, Monitoring, Administratin, Installation, Support
How Kafka will work with Spring WebFlux ?
Kafka Security for Both Producer and COnsumer using SSL or any authentication mechanism. Need to co-related kafka with AWS Kenesis, How it works in Orchastration and Choreography pattern , Can it replace direct Synchronous call for all scenarios

What is message queue
Compare Kafka with other message queue
Kafka Architecture: Terminologies, scalability, brokers, topics, partitions
Kafka Demo: create topic, start a producer, publish messages, start consumer, consume messages

Message Queues: Rabbitmq, Activemq, Zmq, IBM MQ, Kafka, Redis(queue), etc


Direct synchronous communication
Asynchronous communication with message queue


Message queue simplifies the asynchronous communication between applications

Terminologies:
	1. Applications writing data into a queue is called Publisher
	2. Applications reading data from a queue is called Subscriber
	3. Messages are stored in a server application called Broker
	4. Every record of data is called a message
	5. Messages are stored in a sequence inside a Queue
	6. Every message is tracked using a unique per message number called offset
	7. This communication with queue is called PubSub model
	
Break from 11.35 to 11.50 PM!

Kafka Vs Rabbitmq

Kafka Terminologies

Terminology						Rabbitmq		kafka
Queue							Queue			Topic
App writing data into queue		Publisher		Producer
App Reading data from queue		Subscriber		Consumer
Model							PubSub 			Producer-Consumer
Message Delivery				Push mechanism	Pull Mechanism
